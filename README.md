## The Overview
The project uses a machine learning model to make crime prediction in a community based on the economic and demographic information among several areas of the community. We selected around 10 types of features affecting the high-crime area. The algorithms that were involved in the modeling range from KNN, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Machine, Linear Regression, Polynomial SVC, Polynomial Features, Decision Tree Classifier, and Ridge Regression. 

## Motivation
We started enhancing our skillset in predictive analytics class in the BUAN 6337 coursework under the guidance of professor Joonhwi Joo. We got to learn the mathematics and statistics involved in machine learning. Through this project, we feel that we will be able to work on a real-world application to actually make a difference by predicting the crime and also take necessary actions accordingly to decrease the crime rate of the community which we are studying. 

## Installation 
The code is written entirely on Jupyter notebook in Google collab.

## Technology Used
We have made use of Python programming language to execute the project.

## Future scope of the work/project
By predicting the crime of the community, we can take certain actions to prevent the crime from happening in the future. The police authorities and the state department can take vital decisions related to public welfare and safety accordingly.
